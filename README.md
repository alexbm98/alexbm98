- 👋 Hi, I’m Alejandro 😄
- 👀 I’m interested in Videogames, and I'd love working as a Videogame Developer. I'm currently finalizing my Computer Engineering degree, and I'm looking forward
      to study a master's degree about Videogame Development after that.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about Unity, developing 3D and 2D games and gaining knowledge about all the phases that compound a videogame.
